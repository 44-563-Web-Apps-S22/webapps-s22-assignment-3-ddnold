        <p>I was born in Austin, Texas on May 20th, 2000. I enjoy playing video games sometimes, I mostly just enjoy computers as a whole though. My dad has been in the military until very recently. As a result of this my childhood was spread thinly throughout the United States, at one point I even lived in Alaska. However by highschool I had moved in with my grandma and ended up settling down in Saint Joseph. I had heard a bunch about how NW had a great cs program, and of course I heard about the party scene, so I decided to take my college experience this way. And that is the jist of how I got to typing this today.</p>
        <h1>Avengers: Infinity War</h1>
        <p>I really like this movie because the divulging plots of all the different heros come together super well. It's also action-packed with plenty of funny bits to make it fun for the whole family. Finally, it's one of the only superhero movies where the villian actually wins.</p>
